Introduction
Welcome to Authenticator Lite, a service provided by TechLadu, based in Dubai, UAE. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use our app.

Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. We are committed to protecting your personal information and being transparent about how we handle it.

Information We Collect
1. Personal Information
We do not collect personal information directly through the Authenticator Lite app. The app is designed to function offline and does not transmit any personal data to our servers or third-party services.

2. Technical Data
We may collect certain technical data automatically when you use our app. This may include your device type, operating system, and app version. This data is used solely to improve the app's functionality and ensure compatibility with your device.

How We Use Your Information
1. To Provide the Service
The primary purpose of collecting technical data is to ensure that Authenticator Lite functions correctly on your device. We do not use your personal data for any other purpose.

2. To Improve Our Services
We may use aggregated, non-identifiable data to analyze usage patterns and improve the app. This helps us understand how users interact with the app and identify areas for improvement.

Data Security
We take the security of your data seriously. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

Third-Party Services
Authenticator Lite does not use third-party services to collect or process your personal data. The app operates independently on your device, and your data remains under your control.
